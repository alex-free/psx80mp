# Building PSX80MP From Source

1) `git clone https://github.com/alex-free/psx80mp`
2) `cd psx80mp`
3) `make deps` (if on Linux, for Windows skip this and just ensure you have gcc installed).
4) `make`

Other rules:

`make all` - build all release files for Linux and Windows (requires build on Linux currently).

`make clean` - delete built objects, excluding zip releases generated by `make all`.

`make clean-zip` - delete built objects including zip releases generated by `make all`.
